<p>Yeah Yeah, It's ME</p>
<p>I'm Mr. Li</p>
<p>I'm Liyachuan and I have been studying at China University of Petroleum (East China) since college, 
and now I am a doctoral candidate. I am ashamed that no outstanding papers have been published in English so far,
 but several papers are being submitted. </p>
 <p>My research direction is the low-level visual task processing in computer vision, such as edge detection.
 Strive to find a balance between precision and the number of network parameters. 
 Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions. E-mail: liyachuan@s.upc.edu.cn</p>
